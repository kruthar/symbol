If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

limit is one zero zero zero

counter is one
total is zero

while counter lessthan limit
    if counter modulo three equals zero or counter modulo five equals zero
        total is total plus counter
    fi
    counter is counter plus one
end

print total
