Project Euler #2
https://projecteuler.net/problem=2

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

variable limit is four zero zero zero zero zero zero

variable fib1 is one
variable fib2 is one
variable total is zero

while fib2 lessthan limit do
    if fib2 modulo two equals zero
        variable total is total plus fib2
    fi

    variable swap is fib1 plus fib2
    variable fib1 is fib2
    variable fib2 is swap
end

print total
