Project Euler #2
https://projecteuler.net/problem=2

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

limit is four zero zero zero zero zero zero

fib1 is one
fib2 is one
total is zero

while fib2 lessthan limit
    if fib2 modulo two equals zero
        total is total plus fib2
    fi

    swap is fib1 plus fib2
    fib1 is fib2
    fib2 is swap
end

print total
