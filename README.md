# symbol
A programming language that contains no symbol characters

Silly idea, I know, but just imagine a world where you could program and not have to reach for those pesky curly braces, where you never again have to have to hold Shift to add two numbers together. Introducing symbol, a programming language made completely of non-symbol characters.

I'm still in the planning stage on this and there is currently no interpreter, no tests, no code whatsoever. What IS here are what ever plans I have thought up so far for how I invision this language working. I also have no experience in developing a code language, won't this be fun?! We'll cross that bridge when we come to it.

If you somehow stumbled onto this repo and have any interest in what I am trying to accomplish feel free to use the issue tracker to add ideas and thoughts.
